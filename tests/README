These tests are designed to be run via testrunner-lite.

To run them all:
    zypper install jolla-notes-tests
    testrunner-lite -f /opt/tests/jolla-notes/test-definition/tests.xml -o /tmp/notesresults.xml
    grep FAIL /tmp/notesresults.xml

To run just one:
    /opt/tests/jolla-notes/runtest TESTNAME
where TESTNAME is the name of a tst_ qml file without the .qml extension
