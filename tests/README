These tests are designed to be run via testrunner-lite.

To run them all:
    zypper install jolla-notes-tests
    mcetool -D on  # prevent screen lock while the tests run
    testrunner-lite -f /opt/tests/jolla-notes/test-definition/tests.xml -o /tmp/results/testresults.xml
    mcetool -D off
    grep FAIL /tmp/results/testresults.xml

To run just one:
    /opt/tests/jolla-notes/runtest TESTNAME
where TESTNAME is the name of a tst_ qml file without the .qml extension

Results will be in /tmp/results
